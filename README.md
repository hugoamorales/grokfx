GrokFX (Artifact Extractor) is a standalone utility designed to parse and reconstruct &lt;xaiArtifact> objects from Grok conversation exports. It automatically detects code, data, or document artifacts, saves them as real files, and organizes them by date â€” creating a ready-to-version archive of your AI collaboration outputs.
